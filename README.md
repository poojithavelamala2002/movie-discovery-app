⚙️ How It Works

App Initialization:

index.js is the entry point, rendering the root component App.js into the DOM.

Main Component (App.js):

Renders the Search component for user input and dynamically displays movie results using Movie components.

Search Component (Search.js):

Handles user input, triggers API calls, and passes movie data to the App.js for rendering.

Styling:

App.css and Search.css ensure consistent styling across the app.

Testing:

App.test.js contains simple unit tests to verify the presence of key elements like the search bar.

Performance Monitoring:

reportWebVitals.js helps measure app performance for optimization.
